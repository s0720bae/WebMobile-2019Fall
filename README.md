# WebMobile-2019Fall
Web and Mobile Programming Class

This repository is going to be used for my Web/Mobile Programming Class so that I can put all of my source code, screenshots, and create wiki reports.
It will be divided into 2 parts, Mobile and Web, and split into lessons where each one contains a source and documentation folder.

Refer to wiki for more detailed reports on every lesson
